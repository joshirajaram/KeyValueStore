# Uses the following libraries which come by default with Python 3:
1. os
2. time
3. fcntl
4. sys
5. json
6. fileinput

# To run:
- Add to working directory and import KeyValueStore as a library
- Use public functions to perform CRD operations
- Works on Linux OS (Use Windows Subsystem for Linux to run on Windows like I did.)

# Features to be added in the future:
- Improve space efficiency by enchancing the hashing algorithm.
- Improve time efficiency by using Self Balancing Trees instead of plain indexing.
- Add more functional features like update and query with parameters.
